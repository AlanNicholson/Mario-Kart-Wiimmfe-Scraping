Searches Wiimmfe MKW server for friends and alerts when they join.  
Searches for player name and returns Friend-Code.

-uncomment print(mkDic)   
It can grab all data available from https://wiimmfi.de/mkw    
 could be handy...  


# Use  
- Install dependencies  
`pip install tkinter`  
`pip install BeautifulSoup4`  

- Enter player name. (Only to search non-friend player) (copy/paste weird character names)  
Leave blank and wiiSc will just search and alert friends.   

- Enter how often to check server.  
Don't troll server. 30 Should be fine.   
  
An alert will pop-up when a friend joins. (usually 45 mins after they said they would)  
wiiSc closes.  
You play Mario Kart.  
  
  
# Ideas  
- Graph vs points stats.  
Would require constant monitoring.  

- Create and Gather Time Data
